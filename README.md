## Programming Assignment 1: Visualize Data Using a Chart (From Coursera Data Visualization Course)

### Goals

1. The goal of this assignment is to give some experience with handling and deciding how to visualize some data and to get a feel for the various aspects of the visualization.
2. This assignment will also help me to analyze other visualizations and assess their effectiveness.

### Data

 The data set provided deals with world temperatures and comes from NASA:[ http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)   
 [The origional data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/datavisualization/programming_assignment_1/Programming%20Assignment%20Data%20-%20GISTEMP%20Original.zip)   
 [The provided data for assignment](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/datavisualization/programming_assignment_1/Programming%20Assignment%201%20Data%20New.zip)

### Instructions

1. Take the data from the GISTEMP site, specifically the data from “Table Data: Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means.” Alternatively you can use any data that you would like to explore instead.
2. Parse the data to a suitable format for the tools that you are using – we have provided two files (in JS, TXT, and CSV formats) that contain the data used to make the visualizations here, which is a subset of the data on the GISTEMP site.
3. Visualize the data in any meaningful way you wish, keeping in mind the requirements of the Programming Assignment 1 Rubric. 

### Software

The software used for this assignment is R which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, available at [The R Project for Statistical Computing Website](https://www.r-project.org/)

#### Packages Used

1. plyr
2. R Base Graphics

### The Visualization for Surface Temperature Change
